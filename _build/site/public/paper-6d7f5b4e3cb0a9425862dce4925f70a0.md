In the evolving landscape of scientific research, the ability for papers to "talk to each other" represents a transformative shift towards next-generation literature. This concept, exemplified by the meta-analysis conducted in this Jupyter Notebook, underscores the profound impact of interconnected research facilitated by advanced tools like NeuroLibre, the myst content server, and mdast.

## Case Study

<img src="https://github.com/neurolibre/brand/blob/main/png/neuroxlink.png?raw=true" style="height:60px;"></img>

NeuroxLink is a mini python package to parse [mdast](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast), facilitating cross-paper import of article content from MyST servers. It also introduces some [Plotly](https://plotly.com) functionality to work with data from interactive figures! 


### Importing the papers

:::{admonition} Let's import those papers!

The DOIs of the articles we would like to import are `10.55458/neurolibre.alberta1`, `10.55458/neurolibre.alberta2`, `10.55458/neurolibre.alberta3`, `10.55458/neurolibre.alberta4`, and `10.55458/neurolibre.alberta5`. How convenient is that? üëΩ

We will simply list these DOIs, and instruct `nlx` to fetch them from the content delivery network (CDN) of Neurolibre.

```python
nlx = NeuroxLink(cdn_url="https://cdn.neurolibre.org")

# Define and create a list of DOIs and figures
doi1 = "10.55458/neurolibre.alberta1"
doi2 = "10.55458/neurolibre.alberta2"
doi3 = "10.55458/neurolibre.alberta3"
doi4 = "10.55458/neurolibre.alberta4"
doi5 = "10.55458/neurolibre.alberta5"
dois = [doi1, doi2, doi3, doi4, doi5]
figures = ['fig1', 'fig2', 'fig3']

nlx.import_papers(dois)
```

### Peek into the paper (but programmatically)

:::{admonition} Structured data is magic!

We can run all sorts of enquiries on the structured data we just imported, from the front-matter of the article to the interactive figures, and even the narrative of the article (as if that's the most difficult thing to do)!

Let's access some data from the first ALBERTA article!

:::

```python
paper = nlx.papers[0]
print("\n------------> AUTHORS AND AFFILIATIONS")
print(paper.get_authors(), "\n------------> DEPENDENCIES")
print(paper.get_dependencies(), "\n------------> HEADINGS")
print(paper.headings)
```

### From your paper into my paper

The MyST ecosystem allows embedding outputs cross-reference style, i.e., you can render someone else's output in your article (display-only). Projects like [OXA links](https://oxa.link) will pack a punch for the papers to refer to each other at the level of their content. You can imagine these OXA links as fine-grained DOIs for different parts of the paper.

**What we are doing here is a bit different.** 

We aim to fetch an interactive figure from another article and use the information it contains to generate our own insights, both for display and for further analysis (display and `import`).


:::{admonition} Gotta love interactive figures!
How do we know if there are any interactive figures in this article? Let's inspect the content of first ALBERTA article to find out!
:::

```python
paper.inspect_plotly_figures()
```

:::{figure} #fig3inspect
:label: fig3

Inspecting the content of the article to find interactive figures using `nlx`.

:::{admonition} Creating a plotly object from the structured data

Perfect! There are four plotly figures that were linked using `fig0`, `fig1`, `fig2`, and `fig4`. 

> As we created these example "articles", we know that each paper reported their `AI` as `fig0`. 

Note that **we are not performing any computation here**, instead, **we are taking a special chunk of the paper we imported as structured data and creating a plotly figure out of it**!
:::

```python
fig = paper.create_plotly_object_from('fig0')
fig.show()
```

:::{figure} #fig3cell
:label: fig31

Interesting... What about the `AI` of the second article? Let's find out...


```python
nlx.papers[doi2].create_plotly_object_from('fig0').show()
```

:::{figure} #fig0cell2
:label: fig02

I wonder if there is something extraterrestrial going on here, each `AI` has 6 points, but what's the message they are trying to give???

Let's take a look at the third one...

> üëΩ Okay, this is getting weird and I cannot picture what's going on here. 

Time to put these together and see if `AI` has any insights hidden for us. Are not those aliens weird!

:::{tip} We can treat Plotly as our data standard for interactive figures.
Behind the scenes, `neuroxlink` is parsing these plotly objects to return as the part we are interested in!

And the AI from 5 ALBERTA studies combined into one makes a clear hexagon! Open to interpretation, but it's pretty!

## Now we are talking! Or, is it papers talking to each other? 

`#TalkAboutInsight`



Let's start our meta-analysis by importing 15 figures from 5 ALBERTA studies into this article!

### Correlation matrix

Remember that 5 studies are seeking to understand the relationship between different brain measurements across different brain regions associated with different cognitive functions. However, despite the simplistic nature of the overall methodology, nearly each article represented the bivariate relationship between two variables using a different method!

If this was a traditional paper, we would not be able to run any meta-analysis on these results, since we cannot combine the data across these studies with the reported methods. 

God news is, this is not a traditional paper! We are in a realm where papers can talk to each other, and we can leverage this power to run a meta-analysis on these results!

and this looks almost exactly like the correlation between the `score` and `volume`:

### Take home message: Hang out with the aliens with bigger heads!

#### Enhanced Collaboration and Integration

Traditionally, scientific papers have existed in silos, each presenting its findings in isolation. However, the integration of interactive figures and data across multiple papers, as enabled by NeuroLibre, allows for a seamless flow of information. This interconnectedness fosters enhanced collaboration among researchers, enabling them to build upon each other's work more effectively. By remixing data from interactive figures, researchers can combine insights from various studies, leading to more comprehensive and robust conclusions.

#### Accelerated Discovery and Innovation

The ability for papers to communicate and share data accelerates the pace of discovery. Researchers no longer need to manually extract and reanalyze data from individual studies. Instead, tools like the myst content server and mdast facilitate the automatic import and parsing of data, streamlining the research process. This efficiency not only saves time but also reduces the likelihood of errors, allowing researchers to focus on innovative analysis and interpretation.

#### Democratization of Data

Interconnected papers democratize access to data, making it easier for researchers from diverse backgrounds and institutions to contribute to and benefit from collective knowledge. This inclusivity is crucial for addressing complex, multidisciplinary challenges that require diverse perspectives and expertise. By enabling data remixing and integration, platforms like NeuroLibre ensure that valuable insights are not confined to a single study but are accessible to the broader scientific community.

#### Comprehensive Meta-Analyses

Meta-analyses, such as the one demonstrated in this notebook, are significantly enhanced by the ability to integrate data from multiple sources. The NeuroLibre platform's capability to remix data from interactive figures across different papers allows for a more thorough and nuanced analysis. This comprehensive approach leads to more accurate and generalizable findings, ultimately advancing the field and informing future research directions.

#### Conclusion

The concept of "papers talking to each other" is not just a futuristic vision but a present reality enabled by cutting-edge tools and platforms. By facilitating the integration and remixing of data from multiple studies, NeuroLibre, the myst content server, and mdast are paving the way for next-generation scientific literature. This interconnected approach enhances collaboration, accelerates discovery, democratizes data access, and enables comprehensive meta-analyses, ultimately driving the advancement of knowledge and innovation in the scientific community.
